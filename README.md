# Web landing page for the Tahoe-LAFS project

The goal of this web page is to represent the Tahoe-LAFS project to the public.

It gives guidance on getting started for end-users, developers building with Tahoe-LAFS and hackers interested working on Tahoe-LAFS itself alike.


## Building

This web page is built and deployed by CI.

If you want to pre-view your changes on your local machine before pushing commits, you might want to start a development server.

Issuing this command on a system with Docker runs a web server on http://localhost:4000/ that re-builds the page automatically on source file change:

```sh
docker-compose up
```


## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  Easiest is to open tickets or pull requests directly.  If unsure, join the IRC or ask on the Tahoe-LAFS developer mailing list.
