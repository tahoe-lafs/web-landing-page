Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" â€” meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.19.0, released on
January 18, 2024. Major new features and changes in this release:

Declarative build system based on "hatch".
The ability to creat mutable directories with a given private-key.

Pulled in fixes from CBOR, stopped using the C version of CBOR and
fixed incompatibilities with attrs and cryptography libraries.

Besides all this there have been dozens of other bug-fixes and
improvements.

Enjoy!
