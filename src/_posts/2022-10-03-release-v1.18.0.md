ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File Store, v1.18.0

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" â€” meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.17.1, released on
January 7, 2022.

This release drops support for Python 2 and for Python 3.6 and earlier.
twistd.pid is no longer used (in favour of one with pid + process creation time).
A collection of minor bugs and issues were also fixed.
